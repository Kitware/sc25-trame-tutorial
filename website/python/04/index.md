# 3D Visualization

In that tutorial section we will be using VTK and ParaView with trame.

## Let's start with an existing VTK example

Before running anything you will need to install __vtk__ and its trame widget __trame-vtk__.


> [!WARNING]
> For VTK, you will need to install __trame-vtk__ and __vtk__
> ```bash
> uv pip install vtk trame-vtk
> ```


Also the existing code from VTK example Website is available [here](https://examples.vtk.org/site/Python/GeometricObjects/ParametricKuenDemo/) and also pasted below for convenience.
