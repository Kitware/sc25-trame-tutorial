# Convert it to a trame application

In this hands on session, we will provide an empty VTK window along with some GUI control from Vuetify but you will have to edit the code to integrate the VTK code previously executed so it can run in your browser with all the control connected.

## Option 1 (repo)

```bash
python ./code/04-visualization-3d/02-vtk-trame-edit.py
```

## Option 2 (copy/paste)

### Create file with content

Create a file `02-vtk-trame-edit.py` and paste the content below into it.

<<<< ../../../../../code/04-visualization-3d/02-vtk-trame-edit.py

### Run example

```bash
python 02-vtk-trame-edit.py
```

## Result 

![](/python/04/vtk-trame-edit.png)
Then with some edits you should get
![](/python/04/vtk-trame-solution.png)

Also the final code should be 45% smaller than the pure VTK version.
