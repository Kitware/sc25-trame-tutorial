# Getting started

The Python track aims to provide the most developer friendly environment by letting the user leverage its own system for running and editing Python code while ensuring system isolation by always using virtual environments.

## Fetching hands-on

While not fully required when you are following the tutorial from the website as code will be provided directly in the pages which will allow you to copy-paste it into local files for testing.

But if you rather have all the content on your drive right away, you can use __git__ to download the tutorial repository. The command line given below will clone the repository on your system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kitware/sc25-trame-tutorial.git
```

## Tutorial layout

This section of the tutorial is split in 6 sessions of 30 minutes with some slides overview and hands-on. The hands-on are a mix of examples and exercises. 

1. [__Trame fundamentals__](/python/01/) aims to introduce the core concepts behind trame with hands-on showing syntax and core logic.
2. [__Dynamic Web Interface__](/python/02/) aims to expand on the syntax of the web templating infrastructure and how to take advantage of it.
3. [__Vuetify for beautiful UI__](/python/03/) aims to go beyond basic HTML and start leveraging a widget library for building complete and appealing user interface while requiring less knowledge of HTML and CSS.
4. [__3D Visualization__](/python/04/) aims to cover how VTK and ParaView can be used inside a trame application. This include enabling local and remote rendering solutions.
5. [__2D Charts__](/python/05/) aims to cover how to integrate the charting capabilities of libraries like matplotlib, plotly and altair with trame. 
6. [__Interactive data processing__](/python/06/) aims to brings everything together in a complete solution where the interaction is key for exploring data in a different way.
