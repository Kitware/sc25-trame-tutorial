# Building Interactive Dashboards for the Beam, Plasma & Accelerator Simulation Toolkit (BLAST) with trame

The Beam, Plasma & Accelerator Simulation Toolkit (BLAST) is a comprehensive suite of simulation codes for modeling particle accelerators, beams, and plasmas. This talk presents our experience leveraging trame to develop interactive dashboards for the BLAST codes WarpX and ImpactX. We will present how trame is enabling more intuitive and efficient simulation workflows, as well as the integration and control of digital twin infrastructures that combine simulations, AI/ML models, and experimental data.

## Presentation

Axel Huebl from Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory will do the presentation of that work.

## Hands-on

We will cover form handling with nested reactive structures.
