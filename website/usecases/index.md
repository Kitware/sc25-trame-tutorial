The use case session will cover many usage of trame across National Laboratories and industry.

- Logan from Idaho National Laboratory will present __Evolving Peacock into a more robust interface for MOOSE modeling and simulation__ with some hands-on exercise using the xterm widget used inside Peacock.
- Axel from Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory will present __Building Interactive Dashboards for the Beam, Plasma & Accelerator Simulation Toolkit (BLAST) with trame__ with some hands-on exercise using nested structure to drive forms data.
- Brian from M-Star will present __Skip the process bloat and run your CFD anywhere with M-Star & trame__ with some simulation hands-on using some web UI.
- David from Los Alamos National Laboratory will present his Genomic project using ParaView and trame to enable visualization at scale. The hands-on session will present the ParaView Trame Components as an easy way to build applications around ParaView and trame.
- Victor from Argonne National Laboratory will present __Real-Time Simulation Control and Visualization through trame__.
- Sebastien from Kitware will present __Natural Robustness Testing and Model Explainability for AI Test and Evaluation__ and how trame is getting used to ease the understanding of those two toolkits. The hands-on will focus on running those trame AI focused applications locally.
