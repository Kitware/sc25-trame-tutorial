# Explaining model robustness combining saliency maps and natural robustness testing using XAITK and NRTK

AI is everywhere, but how much could we trust it? In this talk we'll go over the concerns of DoD and how Kitware is addressing some of those concerns with two Open Source projects. First we'll cover the Natural Robustness Toolkit (NRTK) and then the Explainable AI Toolkit (XAITK). Finally we'll explain how trame is helping those toolkits with its interactive data exploration approach.

## Presentation

Sebastien Jourdain from Kitware will do the presentation of that work.

## Hands-on

We will setup a virtual environment with everything needed to run both applications locally so people could explore those toolkit in an intuitive and easy fashion.
