# 4D Genome Visualization: Prototype to Web Application with Paraview and trame


Complex datasets often require a mix of novel software development and visualization design -- in collaboration with domain scientists -- to achieve truly useful visualizations. Scientists and vis experts need to work with data and try things out in order to design effective tools. How can we make the most of the time we have with scientists to develop truly useful visualizations? In this talk, we will discuss an example of using ParaView and Trame to effectively and efficiently work with domain scientists to prototype visualizations for complex data artifacts, filter and fuse data for visualization, and develop a web-based end user application.

## Presentation

David H. Rogers from Los Alamos National Laboratory will do the presentation of that work.s

## Hands-on

We will cover ParaView Trame Components.
