# Evolving Peacock into a more robust interface for MOOSE modeling and simulation

MOOSE facilitates the tight or loose coupling of multiple physical phenomena, essential to reactor simulation. Nuclear reactors involve several physical phenomena provided by NEAMS codes that are coupled and correlated with each other through MOOSE. We will present the trame-based evolution of Peacock and how it has transformed Peacock into a more capable interface for MOOSE modeling and simulation. 

## Presentation

Logan H. Harbour from Idaho National Laboratory will do the presentation of that work.

## Hands-on

We will cover terminals in trame using trame-xterm.
