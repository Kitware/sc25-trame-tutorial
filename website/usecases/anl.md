#  Real-Time Simulation Control and Visualization through Trame

We present a system for real-time control and visualization of scientific simulations using Trame, enabling seamless interaction between users and running simulations. Through an intuitive web interface, users can steer simulation parameters during execution and immediately observe the effects via in situ visualization. This bidirectional communication model supports dynamic exploration and lays the foundation for responsive, interactive digital twins. By integrating simulation control and visualization in a unified workflow, we enable faster insight generation and more adaptive scientific experimentation.

## Presentation

Victor A. Mateevitsi from Argonne National Laboratory will do the presentation of that work.

## Hands-on

To be defined later.
