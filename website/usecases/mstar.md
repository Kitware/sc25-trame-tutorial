# Skip the process bloat and run your CFD anywhere with M-Star & trame

M-Star CFD is a GPU-based fluid simulation tool designed to accelerate model development for industrial systems. When trame is coupled to M-Star using ArrowFlow, those capabilities become accessible to a larger set of users. In this talk we show how organizations are able to cut through common barriers to put the predictive abilities of CFD in more peoplesâ€™ hands.

## Presentation

Brian DeVincentis from M-Star will do the presentation of that work.

## Hands-on

We will explore a parameter optimization in a CFD simulation with ArrowFlow for getting real-time results and feedback. For example, we will be looking at finding the optimum frequency or velocity that will transfer sloshing fluid from one container to another.
